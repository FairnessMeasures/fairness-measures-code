# Measures and Benchmarking




You can test any of the provided datasets or your own for bias using the following implemented benchmarks.

- Mean Difference

- Normalized Difference

- Impact Ratio

- Odds Ratio

- Area Under the Curve (AUC)

- Normalized Discounted Cummulative Gain (nDCG)



We continuously define and/or implement methods for benchmarking algorithmic bias using current measures as well as our own.
To find out more about the underlying theory, consider these research outcomes:
