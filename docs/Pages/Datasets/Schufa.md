<b>Description:</b> Two datasets are provided.  the original dataset, in the form provided
                    by Prof. Hofmann, contains categorical/symbolic attributes and
                    is in the file "german.data".                    For algorithms that need numerical attributes, Strathclyde University 
                    produced the file "german.data-numeric".  This file has been edited 
                    and several indicator variables added to make it suitable for 
                    algorithms which cannot cope with categorical variables.   Several
                    attributes that are ordered categorical (such as attribute 17) have
                    been coded as integer.    This was the form used by StatLog.
